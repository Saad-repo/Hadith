<p>
<span class="teal">"One day we were sitting in the company of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him), when there appeared before us a man dressed in extremely white clothing; his hair was extraordinarily black. There were no signs of travel on him and none of us knew him.</span>
</p>

<p>

He [proceeded until] he sat before the Messenger (peace be upon him), his knees supported against the Prophet's, his palms placed on his thighs, and said, <span class="blue">"O Muhammad, tell me about <strong>Islam</strong>."</span><br>

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, <span class="green">'Islam is to testify that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and that you establish prayer, pay zakah [obligatory charity], observe the fast of Ramadan, and perform pilgrimage to [Allah's] House if you have the means to do so.'</span> <i>[The inquirer]</i> said, <span class="blue">"You have told the truth."</span>

[Umar bin Al-Khattab] commented, <span class="teal">"It astonished us that he would ask and then verify the truth."</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>[The inquirer]</i> said, <span class="blue">"Inform me about <strong>iman</strong> (faith)."</span><br>
[Allah's Messenger] replied, <span class="green">'It is that you believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Day of Judgment, and that you believe in Divine Preordination, whether good or bad.'</span> <i>[The inquirer]</i> responded, <span class="blue">"You have told the truth."</span> 
</p>

<p>
He then said, <span class="blue">"Inform me about <strong>ihsan</strong> (beneficence).</span>" <br>
[Allah's Messenger] said, <span class="green">'[It is] that you worship Allah as if you see Him, for though you don't see Him, [you know] He sees you.'</span>

<p>
<i>[The inquirer]</i> said, <span class="blue">"Inform me about <strong>the hour</strong> [of the Day of Judgment]."</span><br>
[The Messenger of Allah] remarked, <span class="green">'The one being asked knows no more than the questioner.'</span>

He [the Holy Prophet] said, <span class="green">'[They are that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress [or master], and that you will find barefooted, destitute goat-herders vying with one another in the construction of magnificent buildings.'</span>
