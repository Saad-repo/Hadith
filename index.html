	<td>‘Umar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: One day we were sitting in the company of Allah's Massenger (peace be upon him), when there appeared before us a man dressed in extremely white clothing; his hair was extraordinarily black. There were no signs of travel on him and none of us knew him. He [proceeded until] he sat before the Massenger (peace be upon him), his knees supported against the Prophet’s, his palms placed on his thighs, and said, "O Muhammad, tell me about Islam." The Messenger of Allih (peace be upon him) said, "Islam is to testify that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and that you establish prayer, pay zakah [obli; atory charity], observe the fast of Ramadan, and perform pilgrimage to [Allah’s] House if you have the means to do s0." [The inquirer] said, "You have told the truth." [‘Umar bin AL Khatib] commented, "It astonished us that he would ask and then verify the truth." [The inquirer] said, "Inform me about imdn (faith)." [Allih’s Messenger] replied, "It is that you believe in Allih, His angels, His Books, His Massengers, the Day of Judgment, and that you believe in Divine Preordination, whether good or bad." |The inquirer] responded, "You have told the truth." He then said, "Inform me about ihsén (beneficence)." [Allah’s Messenger] said, "[It is] that you worship Allah as if you see Him, for though you don't see Him, [you know] He sees you," [The inquirer] said, "Inform me about the hour [of the Day of Judgment]." |The Messenger of Allih] remarked, "The one being asked knows no more than the questioner." [The inquirer] said, 31 "Toll me some of its signs." He [the Holy Prophet] said, "[They ar¢| that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress [or master], and that you will find barefooted, destitute goat-herders vying with one another in the construction of magnificent buildings." [The narrator, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattéb] said, "Then he [the inquirer] went on his way but I stayed with him [Alih’s Messenger] for a long while." He then said to me, "’Umar, do you «mow who this inquirer was?’ I replied, ‘Allah and His Messenger know best.’ He remarked, ‘It was [the angel] Gabriel. He came to you [people] in order to teach you your religion.’" (Recorded by Muslim. )‘" The previous hadith was recorded only by Muslim, however, both Muslim and Al-Bukhary have recorded the narration of Abii Hurayrah (May Allah be pleased with him) who reported, One day the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) appeared before the people when a man came to him and asked, "What is imdn (faith)?" So he (the Holy Prophet) said, "/mén is that you believe in Allah, His angels, His books, the meeting with Him, and His messengers; and that you believe in the Resurrection in the Hereafter." He [the inquirer] said, "O Messenger of Allah, what is Islam?" He replied, Islam is that you worship Allah alone and none other, perform the prescribed prayers, pay the obligatory charity, and fast [the month of] Ramadan. He [then] asked, "What is Asan (beneficence)?" The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) replied, "(ft is] that you worship Allah as if you see Him, for though you (‘) Recorded by Muslim in Kitib Al- Imin (Book on Paith), no. 1/8. 32 don't see Him, [you know] He sees you." [Then] he asked, "When will the Hour [of Judgement] be established?" The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied, "The one being asked knows no better than the questioner, however I will inform you of its portents. One of its signs is that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress [or master]. Another sign is when you see those who are naked and barefoot become the leaders of people. And when the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing with others in the construction of tall buildings, this is one of the signs of the Hour. And the Hour is one of five things which nobody knows except Allih." The Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) then recited, Ley AlSUY) gh Le play Cin S5ity HEU ple Suis AlN Gy p csi ya) tg Lad g 5S Lay Lab cS Je Ca 5 [T* Quay € "asd pale AlN G) which means, (Verily, Allah, with Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs. No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will die. Verily, Alldh is All- Knowing, All-Aware.) (Luqmian, 31:34) Then the man [Gabriel] left and the Prophet (peace be upon him) said {to his Companions], "Bring that man back to me." However, when they set out to bring him back, they did not find any trace [of him]. Then the Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) said, 33 (BN RAJAB) JAMIE 4L-‘ULOM WAL-HIKAM "That was Gabriel, who came to teach the people their religion."

This is a good (Aasan) hadith. It is recorded by Ibn Majah, Ad- Darqutny, and others with a complete chain back to the Prophet (peace be upon him). Malik also recorded it in his A/-Mywatta’ with a chain missing the name of the Companion, from ‘Amr bin Yahya from his father, from the Prophet (peace be upon him). Abi Sa‘id is dropped from the chain. However, the hadith has other chains that strengthen one another.
